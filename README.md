# NYC-Recycle
This project won 2nd prize in Lehman College NSBE 2015 Spring Hackathon. 
It is a web app that enables user to find ten nearest recycle bins in NYC based on their address. 
This project is implemented using JavaScript, AngularJS, Bootstrap and HTML. Google Maps API is 
used to locate latitude and longitude of user's address and Sorcota API contains the database of all 
recycle bins in NYC. Distance Between latitude and longitude of user and each recycle bin is compared. 
Then, 10 nearest recycle bins are listed and shown in map.
